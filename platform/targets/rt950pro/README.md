# Radtel RT-950 Pro

This target is based on the Artery AT32F403A (Cortex-M4F, 1MB flash, 96kB
SRAM). It runs on Zephyr, using the Artery fork of Zephyr and the `hal_at32`
module (`artery` group of `west.yml`).

The hardware description comes from the reverse engineering work done in
[Radtel-RT950-Pro-Firmware](https://github.com/jaymart1983/Radtel-RT950-Pro-Firmware).

## Hardware

| MCU | Artery AT32F403A, ARM Cortex-M4F |
| Transceivers | 2x BK4829 |
| Broadcast RX | SI4732 (FM/AM/SSB) |
| Display | ST7789V, 240x320 |
| External SPI Flash | 4MB, contains config, 64 KiB read back |
| GPS | GPS Module |
| Bluetooth | HC-05 |

## Status

Supported:

- display: ST7789V 240x320 panel on a bit-banged 8-bit 8080 bus. The OpenRTX
  UI is drawn in a 160x128 frame, scaled by 1.5 to 240x192 and centered on the
  panel. The backlight brightness is adjustable from the OpenRTX settings
  (PWM on PC6, TMR8 channel 1). The keypad backlight (PB3) is switched on and
  off together with the display one.
- keypad, side keys, PTT and rotary encoder
- serial logs (Zephyr console) on UART4, at 115200 baud, on the programming
  cable
- power switch: the radio is switched off when the knob is turned off
- battery voltage: ADC1 channel 1 (PA1) through a resistive divider

Not supported yet:

- RF (BK4829)
- FM/AM/SSB receiver (SI4732)
- Audio
- External flash and settings storage
- Bluetooth
- GPS

### Key mapping

| Radio key            | OpenRTX key  |
|----------------------|--------------|
| OK                   | `KEY_ENTER`  |
| Back                 | `KEY_ESC`    |
| Arrows               | Arrows       |
| ABC                  | `KEY_F1`     |
| V/M                  | `KEY_F2`     |
| Top side key         | `KEY_MONI`   |
| Bottom side key      | `KEY_F3`     |
| Encoder              | `KNOB_LEFT` / `KNOB_RIGHT` |

## Building

Requirements:

- Latest OpenRtx zephyr devcontainer which this repo is already based on
- the Python packages needed by Zephyr 4.3, installed once after the first
  container start:
  `uv pip install -r <west topdir>/zephyr-artery/scripts/requirements-base.txt`.

The target is built via `meson` for convenience:

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build openrtx_rt950pro
```

This runs `west update --group-filter +artery` to fetch the Artery Zephyr
fork, `hal_at32` and `CMSIS_6`, builds the firmware with CMake in
`build/rt950pro` and produces:

- `build/openrtx_rt950pro.bin`: raw image, linked at 0x08003000;
- `build/openrtx_rt950pro.BTF`: image for the vendor bootloader.


## Flashing

> **Warning:** This may brick your device! Use at your own risk!

The vendor bootloader (first 12kB of flash) is never overwritten, the original
firmware can be restored at any time with the official update tool.

1. Switch the radio off.
2. Turn the radio on while holding both side keys: the bootloader enters the
   update mode.
3. Connect the programming cable and flash `openrtx_rt950pro.BTF` with the
   python3 scripts/rt950_flash.py upload /dev/ttyUSB0 build_rt950pro/openrtx_rt950pro.BTF --ptt

## Serial logs

Connect the programming cable and open its serial port at 115200 baud, 8N1:

```bash
python3 -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```
